      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>For a long time women have been standing alone against men, we want all women to feel that our brand offers them the opportunity to feel included no matter what their background is. Standing together for feminism! To get our message across we posted several posts on our Instagram page, we also chose to post a reel and a story.</p>
		<ul>
			<p>•	Reach objective: by the 7th of April, we want to reach a 1000 people on our Instagram account. We will do that through posting at least 3 posts on our Instagram, one will be a reel and two of them will be normal posts. We choose to do one reel so we can get our brand out there and get it rolling into the Instagram algorithm, so people that aren’t familiar with our brand will also see it. </p>
			<p>•	Affect objective: by the 7th of April, we want people to feel empowered when they see our message. We will check that through our stories on Instagram. Over there we will portrait our message and ask people through a poll if our message makes them feel empowered. We want to check this, to see which people do find our message important and people who don’t so we can focus mainly on people that do find it important. </p>
			<p>•	Response objectives: by the 7th of April, we want 30 people to have liked our reel on Instagram. We are striving for the thirty likes, because we want to create engagement with our reel not only exposure. We will try to reach this goal by grabbing people’s attention with our reel so they will get triggered to like it and not only watch it. </p>
			<p>•	Response objectives: by the 7th of April, we want a total of 50 people to have liked our posts on Instagram. This is also because we want to create engagement with our brand. We will reach this goal by being active on Instagram and connecting with people. </p>
			<p>•	Response objectives: by the 7th of April, we want a follower count of 70 people. We aim to reach as many people as we can and when people follow us they see our post which will make it more likely for them to interact with it. We will reach this goal by posting frequently and quality content, which will make our potential customers our new followers.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>It was interesting to work on the Communication & Media plan, at first before doing the interviews we taught that we would have to use more than one social media platform to reach our people. However after finding out that our target audience mainly focuses on Instagram we decided to only focus on Instagram which gave us the opportunity to better engage with our audience. So we learned that sometimes less is better, and to only focus on what is beneficial for your own brand or situation.  The first post that we published on our Instagram was a reel, we used a popular sound which helped reach more people than what we were expecting. Thus we learned that when posting a reel, it is a good idea to use a popular sound that people are familiar with, because then they are more likely to look at it. We also learned that people will not always respond to polls, but a learning point might be to also make a post out of a poll instead of just in the stories. This may help to create engagement on our Instagram page. We planned to have gained 70 followers on our page, however we got an total of 62 followers, so that did not go exactly as expected. What we could do differently is to maybe post more times a day. Based on our interviews we could conclude that our target audiences uses Instagram mostly at night, hence why we posted during the evening, but what we could have done differently is to also post during the day, around lunch time. In summary, we learned that you can reach allot of people by posting a reel, especially with a popular sound. We also learned that to reach more followers you would have to be more active with your posts.  </p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      
      <p>For our communication & media plan, we have posted a total of three Instagram posts, with one of them being a reel. For the period of time that we posted we think that this was doable, however for future recommendations we would like to post more times a day. Also we would like to involve our followers more in the product decision. For example asking them what color hoodies they want us to come up with next etc. Give them the opportunity to feel as if they are part of the design team.  </p>
